# SHAP

This repo contains a guest lecture I provided for the module Financial Data Science with Python at Birkbeck College, University of London. This module is part of the MSc Applied Statistics programme.

My aim was to provided a simple overview of SHAP theory and lots of charts so the students can apply this to their work.
